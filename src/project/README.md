# Create a project

Kestrel's cli is the unified tool to run, typecheck, build, format your kestrel projects, and more.

You can install the it via npm:

```bash
npm install -g kestrel-lang
```

A [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ascandone.kestrel-vscode) is also available.

Once you installed the cli, you can create a new project using

```bash
kestrel init
```
